Everything started because I need to *publish html content*, and looking at my
favorites projects in GitHub.com I found GitHub Pages, and then _Jekyll_, so I decided
to start my own.

This does not aspire to become a blog, just a place to play with these technologies, and there are a few, just to name a few:

-NPM
-Grunt
-Ruby
-Less
