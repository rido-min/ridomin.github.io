A couple of years ago I started to dig into Git, but just to know about how it works for OSS projects. Then TFS announced the support for GIT, so I  feel that I need to learn that thing, and it's everywhere.

Some places where I found Git
-----------------------------

* Visual Studio
* Azure Web Site
* SublimeText
* Cloud9
